# üõçÔ∏è Store Microservices Sample

`Store Microservices` is a fictional online store sample, based on different software architecture and technologies like Microservices Architecture, Vertical Slice Architecture, CQRS pattern, Domain Driven Design, Event Driven Architecture and using Postgres for write side and MongoDb.

In developing this application I try to use new features in .NET 6 and C# 10 based on `Minimal APIs` and .Net Core.

This project is still `In-Progress` and I update it to the latest technologies continuously.

## The Goals of This Project

- The `Microservices Architecture` with `Domain Driven Design (DDD)` implementation.
- Correct separation of bounded contexts for each microservice.
- Communications between bounded contexts through asynchronous `Message Broker` with using `RabbitMQ` with some autonomous services.
- Simple `CQRS` implementation and `Event Driven Architecture` with using Postgres for `Write Side` and MongoDB and Elastic Search for `Read Side`. For syncing Read Side and Write Side I will use [EventStore Projections](https://developers.eventstore.com/server/v5/projections.html#introduction-to-projections) or [Marten Projections](https://martendb.io/events/projections/). we could also sync our Read and Write models with passing some integration event between services for achieving eventually consistency.
- Implementing various type of testing like `Unit Testing`,  `Integration Testing` and `End-To-End Testing`.
- Using [Inbox Pattern](https://event-driven.io/en/outbox_inbox_patterns_and_delivery_guarantees_explained/) for guaranty message [Idempotency](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/IdempotentReceiver.html) for receiver microservice and [Exactly-once Delivery](https://www.cloudcomputingpatterns.org/exactly_once_delivery/) pattern and using [Outbox Pattern](https://event-driven.io/en/outbox_inbox_patterns_and_delivery_guarantees_explained/) for ensuring about any message lost and [At-Least one Delivery](https://www.cloudcomputingpatterns.org/at_least_once_delivery/) rule.
- Using `Best Practice` and `New Technologies` and `Design Patterns`.
- Using `Event Storming` for extracting data model and bounded context (using Miro).
- Using Docker-Compose, Helm and Kubernetes for our deployment mechanism and Also using Terraform as infrastructure as a code.
- Using Istio and Service Mesh for our microservices

## The Domain And Bounded Context - Service Boundary

`Store Microservices` is a simple online store api sample that has the basic business scenario for online purchasing with some dedicated services. There are six possible `Bounded context` or `Service` for above business:

- `Identity Service`: the Identity Service uses to authenticate and authorize users through a token. Also, this service is responsible for creating users and their corresponding roles and permission with using [.Net Core Identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/identity) and Jwt authentication and authorization. I will add also [Identity Server](https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/IdentityServer) in future for this service. Each of `Administrator`, `Customer` and `Supplier` are a `User`, actually a `IdentityUser`. To be a User, User Registration is required. Each User is assigned one or more User Role.
Each User Role has set of Permissions. A Permission defines whether User can invoke a particular action or not.

- `Catalog Service`: The Catalog Service presents the ability to add items to our store, It can be electronics, foods, books or anything else. Items can be grouped into categories and catalogs. A catalog is defined as a list of items that a company showcases online. the catalog is a collection of items, which can be grouped into categories. An item can be assigned to only one category or be direct child of a catalog without any category.
Buyer can browse the products list with supported filtering and sorting by product name and price. customer can see the detail of the product on the product list and in the detail page, can see a name, description, available product in the inventory,...

- `Customers Service`: This service is responsible for managing our customers information, track the activities and subscribing to get notification for out of stock products

- `Order Service`: The Orders Service main purpose is to store order details and manage orders created by users on client side. This service is not designed to be a full order processing system like ERP but serves as storage for customer orders details and can be synchronized with different external processing systems.
Some of this service responsibilities are `Saving orders`, `Saving order drafts`, `Ability to view and manage fulfillment, packages`, `Change discounts`

- `Payment Service`: The payment service is responsible for payment process of our customer with different payment process and managing and tracking our payment history

- `Shipping Service`: The Shipping Service provides the ability to extend shipping provider list with custom providers and also provides an interface and API for managing these shipping providers.
Some of shipping service capabilities are `Register Shipping methods`, `Edit Shipping method`, `Shipment details`, `Shipping settings`
